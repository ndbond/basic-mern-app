# basic-mern-app
A simple MERN stack app, seperated into client, server, and database containers. I created this for when I want to stand up a website fast without all the work.

Currently only tested on CentOS Stream 9

To download and use:

<code>git clone https://github.com/ndbond/basic-mern-app.git
cd basic-mern-app
docker-compose up --build</code>

Then, visit `localhost:3000` and you should have a server stood up.
